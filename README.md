# Alzheimer_AI ðŸ§ 

**Alzheimer_AI** is an artificial intelligence model for detecting Alzheimer's disease from blood transcriptomic data, trained using machine learning for high predictive accuracy.

## ðŸ”¬ Motivation

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex multifactorial neurodegenerative condition, currently diagnosed through costly or invasive methods (e.g., PET scans, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers). There is an urgent need for **non-invasive**, sensitive strategies for early detection. This project aims to provide a high-performance solution based on blood RNA biomarkers for Alzheimerâ€™s diagnosis.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- Training of classic **machine learning** models (SVM, neural network, logistic regression)
- Feature selection based on **variance anamorphism** and **PCA**, prioritizing genes related to oxidative stress and mitochondrial translation
- Robust performance evaluation (ROC metrics, accuracy, F1â€‘score, MCC)
