# Alzheimer_AI ðŸ§ 

**Alzheimer_AI** is an artificial intelligence model for detecting Alzheimer's disease using blood transcriptomic data. It is trained with machine learning algorithms for high predictive accuracy in early diagnosis.

## ðŸ”¬ Motivation

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex multifactorial neurodegeneration, currently diagnosed through expensive or invasive methods such as PET scans or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. There is an urgent need for **non-invasive** and sensitive strategies for early detection. This project proposes a high-performance RNA-based solution for Alzheimer's prediction.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- Training of classical **machine learning models** (Support Vector Machine, Neural Network, Logistic Regression).
- Feature selection based on **variance filtering** and **PCA**, focusing on genes related to oxidative stress and mitochondrial translation.
- Robust performance evaluation using ROC, Accuracy, F1â€‘Score, and MCC metrics.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

- **Support Vector Machine**: ROC â‰ˆâ€¯93%, Accuracy â‰ˆâ€¯89%  
- **Neural Network**: ROC â‰ˆâ€¯93%, Accuracy â‰ˆâ€¯86%  
- **Logistic Regression**: ROC â‰ˆâ€¯89%, Accuracy â‰ˆâ€¯89%  

SVM showed the best overall performance across all metrics.
